# Mask-Wearing Prediction Project
The objective of this project is to utilize statistical learning models to predict how often individuals wear masks around people who do not live in their homes, using survey data.

#### Purpose
The primary goal of this project is to employ statistical learning models to predict mask-wearing frequency among individuals living alone, based on survey data. Given the importance of mask-wearing in mitigating the spread of COVID-19, this project aims to investigate the factors influencing mask-wearing behavior among A&M students. By analyzing these factors, the project seeks to develop a predictive model to understand and potentially improve mask-wearing frequency.

#### Problem
The COVID-19 pandemic has necessitated widespread mask-wearing as a preventive measure against virus transmission. However, adherence to mask-wearing practices varies among individuals, and the efficacy of this preventive measure is often debated. This project aims to address these issues by predicting mask-wearing frequency among individuals living alone, particularly focusing on A&M students. By examining the factors influencing mask-wearing behavior, the project endeavors to develop a predictive model that can provide insights into mask-wearing habits and contribute to efforts aimed at promoting public health.
